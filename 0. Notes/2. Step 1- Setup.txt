You will probably need to reference the flask-sqlalchemy documentation (https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)


 and/or the SQLAlchemy (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/) documentation while you complete this exercise.


Python libraries
Install the flask, sqlalchemy, flask_sqlalchemy, and jinja2 libraries into your environment.

Create a SQLite file
Create a new SQLite file called library.sqlite within the existing /data directory.

Initialize the Flask app
Create a file called app.py in the project’s root directory (at the same level as the data/ and templates/ directories).

Import these packages at the top of app.py:

from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

Create an instance of the Flask application after the imports.
